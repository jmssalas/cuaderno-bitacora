  	It has been a hard week, five days speaking english all the time with people who I still did not know, but finally I knew. I have to admit at the beginning of this week, I thought it was going to be a real shit, but in the end, it was totally diferent.
  </p>

  <p>
  	The reason why I thought it was going to be a real shit was that we were 120 students and there were many small groups instead of a big one. Understandably, with 120 students it's impossible for everyone to be together. I compared this time with the last, where we were about 30 students, two totally different situations.

  	My goal this time was to get more fluency and confidence speaking english. I wasn't expected to learn more english unlike the last time. I'm not talking about being a genius in english right now, I never thought about it, but last time I did'nt know anything and in that course I learnt a lot. And both times, my goals has been completed.
  </p>

  <p>
  	Surprisingly some teachers told me that my english is really good and that I speak with fluency and good accent. That was a big surprise to me, because I never thought my english was good, all I knew was that it was useful to me when I was in Czech Republic.

  	I have met many people this course, not all of 120 students but many of them, and I had a great time with them. Also, many of them are from Barcelona, and it's really good, little by little, I meet people here. I hope we can meet each other here and not lose friendship.
