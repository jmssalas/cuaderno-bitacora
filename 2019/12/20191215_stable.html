  	Sometimes I wonder if it's time to change again and I have always replied not yet, because I'm stable and I'm very well now, living in Barcelona, meeting a great people, working very hard and learning a lot. Perhaps, the reasons why I ask myself this question it I haven't felt so comfortable for a long time, and that makes me feel a little weird and doubt if it's possible and real.

  	I don't know if I'm doing the right thing or I'm wrong, but I feel it and I need to leave myself out of thoughts, let it be myself and feel whatever it feels. It's time, after almost three years.
