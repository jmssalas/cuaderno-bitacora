  	Just see the street, the same street which I saw six months ago, but my eyes see it different. It does not seem in the same way to me and it forces me to ask myself if all these months have been for something or simply have been months.

  	I think the answer of that question is I have grown up and I am maturer and I cannot see the same things in the same way, because in that way, I am not the same.
