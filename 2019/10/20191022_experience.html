	Sometimes, life is funny. Sometimes, it is hard. Sometimes, you don't know how to treat it, or how to act. But in these scenarios it is where you can improve yourself, where you have to do your best and the rest will be what it has to be.

  	Today, two hours from now, I have my first challenge. I am really excited and nervous, and very scaried too. I don't know what will happend, but I will try to do my best and whatever happends, I have one more experience, whether it is bad or good.
