    First thing I thought when I just woke up was: "What the hell am I doing? It's too early!". And maybe it's right. It was 7:00 in the morning. I'm sleepy and I know it will be hard for me, but I need to force me. I know I am able to do so.

  	Also, if it is already difficult to write in Spanish, now in English it will be more difficult. However, I know it will be good for me. Fortunately, I met a girl who adviced me to start writing in English. We were talking about writing, reading and other things, And she asked me in which language I used to write and I told her I only write in Spanish, my mother tongue, and I never thought writing in other language.

  	As a teacher, she told me writing English will help me to have more confident and fluency, and here I am, my first time I write in English. First of all, I want to apologize for my English. I know it is bad and I know I have to improve it.
