  	Surprisingly, it was really good, I think I'm still not aware of what happended. It was my first time I had to talk to a client alone, just him and me. Also, I had to explain and propose him a big data strategy for the new version of his app.

  	Both of us finished the meeting with good feelings, and I was very comfortable with the situation and with the result of the meeting. I am so proud of me, for doing it alone and doing it right. Now, I know I'm able to do more things than I thought I couldn't.
