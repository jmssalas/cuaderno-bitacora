  	I just want to let it go, write it and forget it. Well, I won't forget it. <br>
  	Because it was the firt time I really felt comfortable <br>
  	although I knew that it wasn't going to be more than it was.

  	Yes, after years, I felt comfortable, I was nervous but sure of myself. <br>
  	The interview wasn't good, they were looking for people with work experiences that I don't have, <br>
  	but I'm very proud of myself as I was able to understand him and explain myself.

  	It was a very good opportunity, a start-up from UK and the job was there. Honestly, I was hopeful about the possibility of leaving Spain, something I always wanted. The first time I had an english interview, it was really, really bad, I wasn't able to understand the interviewer and I had no words to explain myself. I don't remember exactly but I think it was a year and an half ago.

  	There's always a good point, and this time, the good point is that now I know I'm able to have an english interview, something that I doubted.
